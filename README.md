1. Prerequisite:
   - Go to [https://symfony.com/download](https://symfony.com/download) and follow the instructions on how to download a standalone binary called symfony. This is not Symfony itself... it's just a little tool that'll help us do things, like start new Symfony projects, run a local web server or even deploy our app to production.
   - Installed it, open a terminal and move into any directory. Check that the symfony binary is ready to go by running:
        ```
        symfony --help
        ```
   - This makes sure that we have everything on our system needed to run Symfony, like PHP at the correct version and some PHP extensions. Its stands for check requirements
        ```
        symfony check:req
        ```
